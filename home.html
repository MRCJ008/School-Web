                    Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara, CMI (10 February 1805 – 3 January 1871) was an Indian Syro-Malabar
                    Catholic priest, religious, philosopher and social reformer. He is the first canonised Catholic 
                    male saint of Indian origin and was a member of the Syro-Malabar Church, an Eastern Catholic church.
                    He was the co-founder and first prior general of the first congregation for men in the Syro-Malabar Church, 
                    the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI), and of a similar one for women, the Congregation of the Mother of Carmel (CMC).
                    Kuriakose Chavara started an institution for Sanskrit studies at Mannanam in 1846. A tutor belonging to 
                    the Variar community was brought from Thrissur, to teach at this Sanskrit institution. After establishing the Sanskrit
                    institution in Mannanam, Chavara took the initiative to start a school in a nearby village called Arpookara. On this 
                    Parappurath Varkey wrote in the Chronicles of the Mannanam monastery: “While the work on the Mannanam School began,
                    a place on the Arpookara Thuruthumali hill was located to build a Chapel and school for the converts from the Pulaya caste.
                    " Chavara was the first Indian who not only dared to admit the untouchables to schools but also provided them with Sanskrit
                    education which was forbidden to the lower castes, thereby challenging social bans based on caste, as early as the former 
                    part of the 19th century.

                    It was during this time Bishop Bernadine Baccinelly issued a circular in 1856 which would act as the root cause of tremendous growth of education and
                    hundred percent literacy in Kerala. Kuriakose Chavara was the motivator for such a movement and he successfully convinced 
                    Bishop Bernadine to issue a circular, apparently as an order. It was a warning circular which stated, “each parish should
                    establish educational institutions, or else they will be debarred from the communion”. The schools 
                    in Kerala are commonly called Pallikudams (school attached to Church (Palli)) because of this circular.
                    Kuriakose Chavara took great interest in implementing the circular. He delegated the members of his Congregation to
                    ensure the implementation of the order in the circular and to actively take up educational activities. Each monastery 
                    was to oversee these activities of the parish churches in its neighbourhood.

                    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga (1568-1591) was a young Italian Jesuit novice who embodied extraordinary piety, compassion, and dedication to serving others. Born into a noble family in Castiglione delle Stiviere, Lombardy, Aloysius was raised amidst luxury and privilege. However, he rejected the comforts of his upbringing to pursue a life of spiritual devotion and service.
                    Aloysius's journey toward sainthood began at a young age. He was deeply troubled by the sinful world around him and felt an intense desire to purify his own soul. He adopted rigorous spiritual practices, including fasting, prayer, and self-mortification, to draw closer to God. His devotion was so intense that he renounced his family's wealth and title to join the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1585.
                    As a Jesuit novice, Aloysius demonstrated remarkable humility, obedience, and kindness. He volunteered to care for the sick and dying during the plague outbreak in Rome in 1591. Despite the risk of infection, he nursed the afflicted with unwavering compassion, often sacrificing his own comfort and well-being.
                    Tragically, Aloysius contracted the plague himself and died on June 21, 1591, at just 23 years old. His death was met with widespread mourning, and his reputation for holiness spread rapidly. Aloysius's extraordinary virtues, selflessness, and devotion to serving others during his short life earned him canonization as a saint in 1726.
                    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga's legacy extends far beyond his remarkable life. He has become the patron saint of young people, students, and those afflicted with HIV/AIDS. His feast day, June 21, is celebrated globally, inspiring countless individuals to emulate his virtues and selfless spirit.
                    In conclusion, Saint Aloysius Gonzaga's remarkable life serves as a powerful testament to the transformative power of faith, compassion, and devotion. His unwavering commitment to serving others, even in the face of adversity, continues to inspire generations to follow in his footsteps, striving for a life of humility, kindness, and selflessness.
